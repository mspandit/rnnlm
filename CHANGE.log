0.1g:
- classes at output layer are used to limit computational cost of normalization; speedup ~50x with only small performance loss!
- discarded -vocab-threshold, -compression

0.1h:
- loops rewritten; ~20% better performance
- blas option removed
- changed output during training
- progress of training is shown (switch -debug 2)
- added '-beta' parameter for setting L2 regularization parameter
- added '-one-iter' parameter: performs one iteration over training data and saves the resulting model; does not use valid data
- specifying '-alpha' as a parameter now overrides value found in the model file; can be combined with '-one-iter' to perform adaptation on new data
- added '-min-improvement' parameter to control speed of training process (can be turned off by specifying '-min improvement 1.0')
- added '-anti-kasparek' option to allow more stability during training in unstable environments (saves model during iterations after processing specified amount of words)
- improved bptt implementation, more than 3x speed for large bptt values now (controlled by bptt_block defined in rnnlmlib.cpp)

0.2a:
- improved BPTT implementation, added '-bptt-block N' switch so that error is propagated after N examples, which results to BPTT step + N complexity
  of training instead of BPTT step * N

0.2b:
- added '-direct N' parameter to allow direct connections between top N words at input and output layers + between all input words and
  all classes at output layer (for values >0)

0.2c:
- added '-independent' switch: sentences are processed independently, with no across sentence boundary information (hidden layer is erased at end of sentence symbol); should be used both for training and test phases

0.3a:
- rewritten implementation of direct connections; now active neurons are hashed, not all weights (much faster) + added '-direct-order N' parameter, that sets order
  of dirrect connections (up to 20); this model alone works very well for character-based models (with -class 1 option to switch classes off)
- weights are now not reloaded if the improvement is too small
- TODO: include all things from 0.2c version

0.3b:
- changed few minor things; direct connections are now specified in millions by '-direct N'
- added modififed '-independent' switch

0.3c:
- support for binary format of model files: use '-binary' option for training; the resulting model is ~2x smaller and models are saved and loaded several times faster
- added '-gradient-cutoff' to control maximum size of gradient (to avoid exploding gradient problem)
- nbest lists can be now read from stdin: use '-nbest - < nbestlist.txt'
- added support for compression layer using '-compression N' switch, where N is number of neurons; the compression layer is additional hidden layer between recurrent hidden layer and output+class layer; can be used to reduce computational complexity if many classes are used (useful probably only on very large data sets)
- ME part of the model can now use more than 2^31 (~2G) features

0.3d:
- few small bugs removed
- new algorithm for computing classes: works a bit worse (~2% in PPL), but with small hidden layer and large output layer, provides large speed-ups (~2-4x) - thanks to Dan Povey
- old classes can be used if model is trained with '-old-classes' option

0.3e:
- parameters -old-classes and -independent are now stored in model file to avoid problems
- removed bug in generation of words from RNNME models - thanks to YongZhe Shi

0.4a (see CHANGE-Cantab.log for details):
- switched to using floats instead of doubles for speed and size
- an even faster exp function used (from Paul Mineiro - http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2011/06/fast-approximate-logarithm-exponential.html)
- safe softmax implemented
- max-iter added (if -min-improvement set to 0.0 this allows for tests where training has a static learning rate and proceeds for a set number of iterations)
- fixed bug in example.sh for first invocation

0.4b (see CHANGE-Cantab.log for details):
- now use make  make CC=g++ WEIGHTTYPE=float to get float weights and direct connections (default is double)
